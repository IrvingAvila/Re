# Redirecting with GitHub pages examples

This is a quick demo showing you how you can redirect markdown files in GitHub pages using an HTML template.

## Plain redirect

This just sends the user directly to the URL you provide. Try [plain-redirect.md](plain-redirect)

```markdown
---
layout: forward
target: https://example.com
---
```
